Unfortunately, existing methods often fail to identify patterns relevant to long-term SOC estimation due to complex battery cell characteristics such as aging. In this paper, we propose the Uncorrelated Sparse Autoencoder with Long Short-Term Memory (USAL). USAL is a novel neural network that addresses the challenging task of long-term SOC estimation given a limited initial history of a cell’s charge-discharge behavior. USAL uses a multi-task learning strategy to harness the advantages of sparse autoencoders and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks by enforcing correlation penalties. The USAL simultaneously learns to (i) generate a latent space of informative SOC encodings from commonly measured cell characteristics, (ii) penalize for high multicollinearity between encodings, and (iii) identify non-trivial long and short temporal correlations between the encodings using LSTM cells. USAL outperforms benchmarked models in our experiments when trained on five initial charge-discharge cycles across multiple battery cells using three publicly available accelerated aging datasets. Note to Practitioners —This paper proposes USAL, a custom-built deep neural network to address the challenging task of long-term SOC estimations in battery cells. Long-term SOC estimation involves estimating SOC for cycles near End-Of-Life (EOL) given some initial charge-discharge cycles. Three fundamental steps involved in long-term SOC estimations using USAL are (i) exploiting a multi-task learning strategy to learn efficient encodings given limited training data, (ii) penalizing these encodings for high correlations to efficiently transform measured inputs into a space of informative features, and (iii) mapping of aging-related trends to support long-term SOC estimations. USAL is designed to be a data-driven SOC estimation method that is (i) capable of alerting the user to a faulty cell when integrated into a real-life Battery Management System (BMS) and (ii) identifying the relative quality of a battery cell from only a few initial charge-discharge cycles.","tags":[],"title":"Uncorrelated Sparse Autoencoder With Long Short-Term Memory for State-of-Charge Estimations in Lithium-Ion Battery Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mayuresh Savargaonkar"],"categories":null,"content":"This talk was presented at the INFORMS Annual Meeting and was sponsored by the QSR division.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel method for estimating the SOC of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cells by accurately modeling the cell aging and degradation information. The proposed method, termed as NNGP, is a deep neural network with Gaussian process feedback. The novel Gaussian process feedback helps the NNGP correlate SOC trends over consecutive charge-discharge cycles. Instead of time, the NNGP leverages available energy to correlate these SOC trends. The deep neural network within the NNGP then utilizes this information and other measured inputs to capture long-term cell aging and degradation trends. The NNGP leverages the most recent cell information to adapt its weights and estimate the SOC by employing an adaptive weighted training strategy. In our experiments on four Li-ion battery cells from three publicly available accelerated aging datasets, the NNGP clearly outperforms other benchmarked methods. The NNGP is also shown to be a useful prognostic tool capable of accurately estimating the SOC for up to 25 cycles in the future with an MAE below 3.5%. When tested under dynamic driving conditions and unknown initial SOC, the NNGP is shown to offer considerable improvements over other benchmarked state-of-art methods. The derivation of the model followed by experimental evaluation is presented.","tags":[],"title":"A Novel Neural Network with Gaussian Process Feedback for Modeling the State-of-Charge of Battery Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdallah Chehade","Mayuresh Savargaonkar","Vasiliy Krivstov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656623491,"objectID":"5d4c00aa5856b4000a88b9cd3a91ee16","permalink":"https://mayuresh-savargaonkar.github.io/publication/cgmm/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cgmm/","section":"publication","summary":"Forecasting warranty claims for complex products is a reliability challenge for most manufacturers. Several factors increase the complexity of warranty claims forecasting, including, the limited number of claims reported at the early stage of launch, reporting delays, dynamic change in the fleet size, and design/manufacturing adjustments for the production line. The aggregated effect of those complexities is often referred to as the “warranty data maturation” effect. Unfortunately, most of the existing models for warranty claims forecasting fail to explicitly consider warranty data maturation. This work address warranty data maturation by proposing the Conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (CGMM). CGMM uses historical warranty data from similar products to develop a robust prior joint Gaussian mixture distribution of warranty trends at both, the current and future maturation levels. CGMM then utilizes Bayesian theories to estimate the conditional posterior distribution of the warranty claims at the future maturation level conditional on the warranty data available at the current maturation level. The CGMM identifies non-parametric temporal warranty trends and automatically clusters products into latent groups to establish (learn) an effective prior joint distribution. The CGMM is validated on an extensive automotive warranty claims dataset comprising of four model years and 15,000 different components from 10 million vehicles.","tags":[],"title":"Conditional Gaussian Mixture Model for Warranty Claims Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isaiah Oyewole","Mayuresh Savargaonkar","Abdallah Chehade","Ala A.

The proposed deep neural network transfers knowledge from other cells and adapts its behavior by exponentially weighting the data from the historical cells using a custom weighting function. The proposed model is shown to achieve state-of-art with an MAE of 0.56% when compared with three other traditional transfer learning and adaptive learning models for Li-ion battery cells. Details of the model followed by derivations and experimental results are provided.","tags":[],"title":"An Adaptive Deep Neural Network with Transfer Learning for State-of-Charge Estimations of Battery Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumbhar","Mayuresh Savargaonkar","Aayush Nalwaya","Chengqi Bian","Mohammed Abouelenein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669668581,"objectID":"0a3b1a11f41baf5ffd23b4c30887e434","permalink":"https://mayuresh-savargaonkar.github.io/publication/kumbhar-2019-keyword/","publishdate":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kumbhar-2019-keyword/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a survey-cum-evaluation of methods for the comprehensive comparison of the task of keyword extraction using datasets of various sizes, forms, and genre. We use four different datasets which includes Amazon product data - Automotive, SemEval 2010, TMDB and Stack Exchange. Moreover, a subset of 100 Amazon product reviews is annotated and utilized for evaluation in this paper, to our knowledge, for the first time. Datasets are evaluated by five Natural Language Processing approaches (3 unsupervised and 2 supervised), which include TF-IDF, RAKE, TextRank, LDA and Shallow Neural Network. We use a ten-fold cross-validation scheme and evaluate the performance of the aforementioned approaches using recall, precision and F-score. Our analysis and results provide guidelines on the proper approaches to use for different types of datasets. Furthermore, our results indicate that certain approaches achieve improved performance with certain datasets due to inherent characteristics of the data.","tags":[],"title":"Keyword Extraction Performance Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

The recent few years have shown a lot of growth in the commercial–express feeder consumers. Consequently, the need for energy is going up. Thus to satiate the demand, the utility company needs to produce more electricity, hence increasing the economics. To cope up with the rising cost and escalating demand of electricity we have come up with an indigenous solution. This solution aims at fulfilling electricity demand of the stated consumers by domestically generating electricity. Along with satisfying the demand for electricity of the consumer, a solution for exporting excessively generated electricity to the power grid has also been developed. The power thus generated is at a lower cost as compared to the commercial utility company tariff. This is accomplished with the use of micro steam turbine, its accessories and boiler. Conclusively providing a self-sufficient and profit path to the stated consumer.","tags":[],"title":"Energy Generation Solution Using Steam Turbine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656473479,"objectID":"a36058eafe01cd26b16c80f89806a069","permalink":"https://mayuresh-savargaonkar.github.io/skills/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/skills/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Skills","type":"page"}]
