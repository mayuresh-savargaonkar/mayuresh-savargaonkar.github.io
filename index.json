To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel method for estimating the SOC of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cells by accurately modeling the cell aging and degradation information. The proposed method, termed as NNGP, is a deep neural network with Gaussian process feedback. The novel Gaussian process feedback helps the NNGP correlate SOC trends over consecutive charge-discharge cycles. Instead of time, the NNGP leverages available energy to correlate these SOC trends. The deep neural network within the NNGP then utilizes this information and other measured inputs to capture long-term cell aging and degradation trends. The NNGP leverages the most recent cell information to adapt its weights and estimate the SOC by employing an adaptive weighted training strategy. In our experiments on four Li-ion battery cells from three publicly available accelerated aging datasets, the NNGP clearly outperforms other benchmarked methods. The NNGP is also shown to be a useful prognostic tool capable of accurately estimating the SOC for up to 25 cycles in the future with an MAE below 3.5%. When tested under dynamic driving conditions and unknown initial SOC, the NNGP is shown to offer considerable improvements over other benchmarked state-of-art methods. The derivation of the model followed by experimental evaluation is presented.","tags":[],"title":"A Novel Neural Network with Gaussian Process Feedback for Modeling the State-of-Charge of Battery Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdallah Chehade","Mayuresh Savargaonkar","Vasiliy Krivstov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"5d4c00aa5856b4000a88b9cd3a91ee16","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/cgmm/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cgmm/","section":"publication","summary":"Forecasting warranty claims for complex products is a reliability challenge for most manufacturers. Several factors increase the complexity of warranty claims forecasting, including, the limited number of claims reported at the early stage of launch, reporting delays, dynamic change in the fleet size, and design/manufacturing adjustments for the production line. The aggregated effect of those complexities is often referred to as the ‚Äúwarranty data maturation‚Äù effect. Unfortunately, most of the existing models for warranty claims forecasting fail to explicitly consider warranty data maturation. This work address warranty data maturation by proposing the Conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (CGMM). CGMM uses historical warranty data from similar products to develop a robust prior joint Gaussian mixture distribution of warranty trends at both, the current and future maturation levels. CGMM then utilizes Bayesian theories to estimate the conditional posterior distribution of the warranty claims at the future maturation level conditional on the warranty data available at the current maturation level. The CGMM identifies non-parametric temporal warranty trends and automatically clusters products into latent groups to establish (learn) an effective prior joint distribution. The CGMM is validated on an extensive automotive warranty claims dataset comprising of four model years and 15,000 different components from 10 million vehicles.","tags":[],"title":"Conditional Gaussian Mixture Model for Warranty Claims Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isaiah Oyewole","Mayuresh Savargaonkar","Abdallah Chehade","Ala A.

Training such systems requires substantial time across multiple GPUs and massive labeled training datasets. Although the goal of these systems is generalizability, they are often impractical in real-life applications due to flexibility, robustness, or speed issues. This paper proposes RMOPP- A robust multi-objective post-processing algorithm to boost the performance of fast pre-trained object detectors with a negligible impact on their speed. Specifically, RMOPP is a statistically driven, post-processing algorithm that allows for simultaneous optimization of precision and recall. A unique feature of RMOPP is the Pareto frontier that identifies dominant possible post-processed detectors to optimize for both precision and recall. RMOPP explores the full potential of a pre-trained object detector and is deployable for near real-time predictions. We also provide a compelling test case on YOLOv2 using the MS-COCO dataset.","tags":[],"title":"RMOPP: Robust Multi-Objective Post-Processing for Effective Object Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mayuresh Savargaonkar","Isaiah Oyewole","Abdallah Chehade"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656620872,"objectID":"453286440d1b72722c01809a7a7cc63e","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/savargaonkar-2021-sparse/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T20:27:52.045552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/savargaonkar-2021-sparse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sparse Autoencoded Long Short-Term Memory Network for State-of-Charge Estimations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mayuresh Savargaonkar","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Datasets are evaluated by five Natural Language Processing approaches (3 unsupervised and 2 supervised), which include TF-IDF, RAKE, TextRank, LDA and Shallow Neural Network. We use a ten-fold cross-validation scheme and evaluate the performance of the aforementioned approaches using recall, precision and F-score. Our analysis and results provide guidelines on the proper approaches to use for different types of datasets.
